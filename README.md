## üí° Key Buying Considerations  

| Feature                        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Singlemode vs Multimode**    | Choose based on required transmission distance (Multimode <2km, Singlemode up to 20+ km). |
| **BIDI vs Dual Fiber Modules** | BIDI reduces fiber usage with one strand, ideal for constrained conduit space. |
| **Managed vs Unmanaged**       | Use unmanaged for simple links; choose managed if remote monitoring/config is needed. |
| **Standalone vs Rackmount**    | Rackmount for dense installs; standalone for smaller or remote deployments. |
| **Power Redundancy**           | Industrial GBMM units often offer redundant power inputs for uptime-critical systems. |
